# Embedded CMOS Camera Test Tool

This is a lightweight Python-based tool for evaluating the image quality of embedded camera modules (e.g., Raspberry Pi Camera, Jetson CSI camera). It provides basic functions such as live image capture, automatic exposure control, white balance tuning, and image quality metrics such as SNR and histogram spread.

## Features
- Real-time camera frame capture
- Exposure level feedback and tuning
- Histogram and SNR evaluation
- Data saving and visualization

适用于嵌入式图像系统初学者与成像工程师的轻量级评估工具。
